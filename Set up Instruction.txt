I have used python 2.7.0

1) Create a virtual environment - > virtualenv venv
2) Activate the environment-> call activate
3) Installing all the libraries that is required to run the the graph_vt.py-> pip install -r required_libraries_vt.txt
4) Run graph_vt.py -> python graph_vt.py
5) Check the "output.html" file and json files for each graph id in the "output_folder" of the current directory

Note: I have also attached output_folder.zip for your reference.
